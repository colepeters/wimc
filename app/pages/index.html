    The Winnipeg Insight Meditation Community (WIMC) is a peer led, non sectarian sangha (or community) of meditation practitioners. We share a commitment to the study & practice of the dharma — the teachings of Buddhism — as a means to support one another in bringing awareness, compassion, and wisdom into our daily lives and the lives of our wider communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    We meet each week on Sunday mornings for meditation and group discussion. All are welcome to join. To learn more, <a href="/sessions">read about our weekly sessions</a>. We recommend that those new to our sangha <a href="/orientation">read our orientation</a> before attending their first session.

    As a peer led sangha, our areas of study and discussion change each week. To stay up to date with our sitting times, locations, upcoming discussion topics, and any special events, <a href="/newsletter">subscribe to our newsletter</a>.
